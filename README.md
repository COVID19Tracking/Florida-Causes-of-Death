# Florida Causes of Death
This repository contains Florida's vital statistics data on a weekly basis, collected since June here: https://github.com/COVID19Tracking/Florida-Causes-of-Death. I pull my data weekly from Florida's vital statistics website, www.FlHealthCharts.com. This repository contains data for three different categories spanning multiple years and stratified by region and demographics.

## Data notes
- August, 2020: There is a gap in data in August because the Florida Health CHARTS system was taken offline for renovation. For 2 months afterwards, data slicing for race, ethnicity, and age was halted in some categories due to the unusuability of the system. It has now been resolved and data is collecting as before.
 
 - Jan 10, 2021 Provisional 2021 data is now displayed. 2020 data is still provisional.
