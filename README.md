 Data notes:
 
 August, 2020
 There is a gap in data in August because the Florida Health CHARTS system was taken offline for renovation.
 For 2 months afterwards, data slicing for race, ethnicity, and age was halted due to the unusuability of the system.
 It has now been resolved and data is collecting as before.
 
 Jan 10, 2021
 Provisional 2021 data is now displayed.
 2020 data is still provisional.
